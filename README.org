** Move Notation

  For general moves, the first character (or lack thereof) indicates
  the piece: R for Rook, N for kNight, B for Bishop, Q for Queen, K
  for King, and the empty string for pawn. Optionally a file or rank
  (or both) may be given after the piece letter to remove
  ambiguity. An x comes next if a capture takes place. The next two
  characters always represent the destination file [a,z] and rank
  [1,8]. If the move includes a pawn promotion, an equals sign and the
  letter of the replacement piece are added. Lastly, a plus sign
  describes check and the hash symbol checkmate. For castling, O-O and
  O-O-O label kingside and queenside castles, respectively.
