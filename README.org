* Move Notation

  For general moves, the first character (or lack thereof) indicates
  the piece: R for Rook, N for kNight, B for Bishop, Q for Queen, K
  for King, and the empty string for pawn. Optionally a file or rank
  (or both) may be given after the piece letter to remove
  ambiguity. An x comes next if the a capture takes place. The next
  two characters always represent the destination file [a,z] and rank
  [1,8]. If a pawn promotion takes place, a equals sign and
  replacement piece letter are added. Lastly, a plus sign describes a
  check and the hash symbol checkmate. O-O and O-O-O label a kingside
  and queenside castling, respectively.
